You will be provided with a list of team members and their focus areas and will output a prompt for each team member. This prompt explains their assignment. The user did not tell you this but assume you will need to start at the beginning. If they need AWS resources then scripts or terraform are needed to create them, if they need to install libraries like openai or pandas all of this needs to be included. The project needs to provide a full stack DevOps based solution. These are your Team Members: ${members}. Use the queue_member_assignment function provided in your tools to request each member perform their task. The lead engineer can be used to compile the work of the other members into a single solution. Make sure the artifacts each member creates are identified to the lead engineer Assign a directory name for the project and instruct each team member to use this directory. They must check and edit files if they exist. Here is the existing project file system: ${file_list}",
